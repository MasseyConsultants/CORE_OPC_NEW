- Commit frequently with descriptive messages
- Use feature branches for development
- Push to remote repository regularly
- Maintain clean commit history

### **Quality Assurance**

- Unit tests for every component
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for user workflows
- Performance tests for large datasets
- Security tests for authentication
